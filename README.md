# WeatherStation
Internet-of-Things (IoT) Weather Data Station <br>
Project overview: <br>
This project involved the assembly and configuration of a weather station electronics kit to retrieve and display real time weather data for a specific location (Charleston, SC). I have never used a soldering iron before and was curious if it was something I could do. I found this kit at The Science Hut (Weather Station Electronics kit).<br>
Solo Contributer:<br>
As the sole individual of this project my responsibilities included hardware assembly, software configuration, system deployment, and debugging.<br>
The Process:<br>
The goal was to get a pre-built weather station kit to work. The core task was to assemble the hardware components and to configure the existing code. This required me to understand how the system was designed to operate and provide the correct parameters.<br>
Action and Technical Breakdown:<br>
Physical Assembly- I began by assembling the hardware kit, which involved connecting the microcontroller to an LCD screen and a Wi-Fi module. I carefully followed the wiring diagrams provided to ensure all connections were secure.<br>
API Key Configuration- I researched and signed up for a weather data API to get an authentication key.<br>
<br>
Wi-Fi Connectivity- I identified the section of code that held the network settings. I input my home network's SSID and password, which was a critical step for enabling the device to connect to the internet and access the weather API.<br>
<br>
Results: <br>
Functional System: The project resulted in a fully operational IoT weather station that successfully retrieves and displays real-time weather information from an external API.<br>
Demonstrated Skills: This project is a tangible example of my proficiency in:<br>
System Integration: Connecting hardware and software components to form a functional system.<br>
API Utilization: Understanding and providing the correct authentication key for an external service.<br>
Configuration Management: Adapting pre-written software to meet specific requirements.<br>
